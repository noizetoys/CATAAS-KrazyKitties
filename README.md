# CATAAS-KrazyKitties

Who doesn't love cat (other than me, I'm allergic to small, furry sociopaths)???

Here's an app to look a cute little kitties (iPad only, iPhones are just too small for kitties this AWESOME).  

You can select little kitties and see a bigger picture of them, sort based on tags, and share your favorite kitty pics with the world (not really, I didn't finish that feature completely)

It's written entirely in SwiftUI (cause, awesome!) and only works on iOS 16, because 'latest, greatest'!

Just load the code into the latest version of Xcode (14.whatever), select an iPad, press 'Run' and it's all kitties!!!

Enjoy!
